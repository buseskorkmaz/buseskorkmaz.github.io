I am a PhD student in the Autonomous Industrial Systems Group at Imperial College London where I am supervised by Dr Mehmet Mercangoz. My research focuses on developing safe learning and safe reinforcement learning algorithms to increase autonomy in large-complex cyber-physical systems. I'm also interested in fairness and explainability in large models such as LLMs.

Before my PhD, I was an undergraduate student at Istanbul Technical University studying a double major in Computer Engineering and Industrial Engineering. Upon my graduation, I worked in the industry first as a management consultant and then as a machine learning engineer.
