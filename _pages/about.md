I am a PhD student in the Optimisation and Machine Learning for Process Systems Engineering group at Imperial College London where I am supervised by Dr Antonio Del Rio Chanona. My research focuses on creating safe learning and reinforcement learning algorithms based on probabilistic inference techniques, designed to increase the safe sequential decision-making ability of intelligent systems in the face of uncertainty. I'm also interested in fairness and explainability in large models such as LLMs.

Before my PhD, I was an undergraduate student at Istanbul Technical University studying a double major in Computer Engineering and Industrial Engineering. Upon my graduation, I worked in the industry as a management consultant at McKinsey & Company and then machine learning engineer at Comcast.
