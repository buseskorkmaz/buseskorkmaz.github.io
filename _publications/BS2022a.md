 In this paper, several natural language processing techniques with a varying range from statistical methods to deep learning-based methods were applied on the commodity news. Firstly, the dictionary-based methods were investigated with the most common dictionaries in financial sentiment analysis such as Loughran & McDonald and Harvard dictionaries. Then, statistical models have been applied to the commodity news with count vectorizer and TF-IDF. The compression-based NCD has been also included to test on the labeled data. To improve the results of the sentiment extraction, the news data was processed by deep learning-based state-of-art models such as ULMFit, Flair, Word2Vec, XLNet, and BERT. A comprehensive analysis of all tested models was held. The final analysis indicated the performance difference between the deep learning-based and statistical models for the sentiment analysis task on the commodity news. BERT has achieved superior performance among the deep learning models for the given data.
